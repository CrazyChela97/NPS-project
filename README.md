# Waste Pollution in the United States of America
This project aims at helping no-profit associations that work hard everyday to clean our planet. These associations organize, periodically during the year,missions to clean up specific places (such as beaches, turistic monuments, streets etc.) but also expeditions to clean residual waste islands floating in the oceans. 
During these missions data are recorded, specifically the number of collected items (how many units of waste were collected during that mission), the number of total volunteers (how many people took part at the mission, helping collecting the garbage), the type of the mission (land cleaning or ocean cleaning, for example), a partial classification of recyclable items (Plastic/Foam or Glass/Rubber/Lumber/Metal) and other specific characteristics of each mission, such as the month, the day of the week, the association that organized the expedition etc.
Very often these associations are self-made organizations of few people that just want to make a difference improving their living environment by spontaneously taking part in this kind of expeditions. For this reason there
might be some organization issues in the disposal of the collected waste, indeed usually during an expedition the volunteers collect all the waste in garbage bags and then all these bags are left to the organization behind the expedition to deal with.
So at the end of each expedition the organization will have to manage the correct disposal and recycle of a huge amount of collected items, and in this framework it could be very useful to know a priori the expected amount of garbage we will likely collect during a future mission, according to the number of partecipants and the mission specific characteristics. 
Knowing the expected amount of waste before the start of the mission would be a useful tool for the organization, allowing the organizer to plan beforehand the practical disposal of garbage, taking appointment with some recycling center in order to deliver them a preannounced amount of waste in a specific day, or informing the local dumping sites that they will probably arrive with a consistent quantity of garbage, making sure that there is space for all those bags in order to avoid possible issues. 
To achieve this goal of organization improvement we want to build a prediction model at first for the totality of collected items, and secondly a model telling us how many of these items will be labeled as plastic, needing to be taken to a specific recycling center, obtaining as a consequence also the expected number of items made of "other" materials, that instead will be taken to the dump.
In the report is presented a first description of the dataset we will use during the whole project development, and then we will go further proceeding to analyze the data and looking for the better formulation of the above mentioned models.
